#  Write a microservice in python that takes a URL 
of a static website asan input and identifies all
the unique wordsand how many times they occur on a 
web page. The output is a list of words in JSON format
along with the frequency of occurrence (number of times the word is repeated).







# Code Here






# Code for the microservice: 





import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import json

def get_word_frequency(url):
    # Make a GET request to the URL
    response = requests.get(url)
    # Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    # Extract all text content from the website
    text = soup.get_text()
    # Tokenize the text into words
    words = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
    # Remove stop words from the list of words
    words = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in stopwords.words('english')]
    # Count the frequency of each unique word using a dictionary
    frequency = {}
    for word in words:
        if word in frequency:
            frequency[word] += 1
        else:
            frequency[word] = 1
    # Convert the dictionary into JSON format
    json_output = json.dumps(frequency)
    return json_output








# To test the microservice, you can call the get_word_frequency function with a URL as the input:




url = 'https://www.example.com'
output = get_word_frequency(url)
print(output)
